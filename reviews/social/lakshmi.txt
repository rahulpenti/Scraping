's synopsis on   reads - It makes  , the film, sound like a run-of-the-mill struggle to victory story, which it very well might be. The film though sensitizes you to horrific human trafficking and how helpless the situation is. At the same time, you do realise that real-life must be only worse. The bravery of one girl,   sounds unreal and that is what sets the film apart - it is based on true life.  's bravery is real. The narrative feels so real that many a time, it feels like a documentary. Yet, it is difficult to judge if this would have come through if it were not for the brilliant performances - from  , to   to   to   himself. You feel hatred towards the pimp, Chinna played by   as strongly as you feel   and Jyothi's pain through   and and   respectively.  Equal weightage has to be given the unavoidable crass language. It's not just the curse words but the brazen lines with which prostitution and related issues are portrayed that hits you but not in a wannabe way. It is perfectly in tune with the subject in hand. When it comes down to stories based on real life with soulful narration, there is very little to say other than, "go watch it, because you need to."  Of course,   is a very difficult and intense watch - for women, for sure, and hopefully for men too.
