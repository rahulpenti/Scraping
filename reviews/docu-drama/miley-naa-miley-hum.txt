 is a launch vehicle for politician,  's son   and unfortunately stays just that - carrying on its arms tropy heroine,  , of course. The basic plot had the charm to be a warm family film but ends up being a bland, predictable affair, especially post interval.  looks sincere but has a long way to go before his face and body learn how to convey what his character feels/wants to say. And I appeal to all dialogue writers, please, please stop giving   English lines - pronouncing "career" as "carrier" I'd let go, but "means" as "mince", please have mercy on us! The two saving graces of this otherwise almost debacle are   and  's voice. Actually,   has a couple of scenes in which his eyes express everything that his otherwise dead expression don't convey throughout the film.  The basic plot is interesting but with the ridiculous twist midway, it has no surprises or believability left. Had they somehow masked that twist and if there was some chemistry between the lead pair there was half a chance for   to be a decent film. Alas, its just another one of those films that you'll stop at in your channel-surfing mode, just to check out what Ram Vilas Paswan's son looks like.
