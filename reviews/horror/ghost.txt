One of the first few lines in   go, "I'm a doctor. I have to behave responsibly, right?" And this along with the typical texture that goes with a B-grade horror film, seal the deal as far as how good the film is going to be. And the case gives itself little chance to be re-opened. The little chance is afforded by the way in which spooks are created the first couple of times. Slimy insects and hardcore gore begin to do the do only to be rudely interrupted by special effects that make the images look like they are shot with a   of some sort. I'm all game for filmmakers experimenting with techniques, but unfortunately this looked like a cop-out - a method in which they could avoid showing the implied gore. Or use of this technology was more feasible than the refined   that would be needed to pull it off.  That could've made the film better in terms of number of genuine creeps provided. Unfortunately, the creeps come from cheesy dialogues in romantic situations like, "Why are you so beautiful, Suhani?" or "I'll not forget you till I forget myself." Incidentally, this is supposed to be a break from the 'intense' horror situations and thus the love affair is rhythmically interspersed with the core of the Ghost story.  Usually this genre leave enough opportunities for the actors to scream, squeal and thus show their acting prowess. But  's story doesn't have room for that because the lead pair barely every faces the spirit that's causing terror. Our man   has one break-down but that's about it.   has a few sequences to give a moderately scared expression and she quite firmly holds that one through most scenes - including the romance.
