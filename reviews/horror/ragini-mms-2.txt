Here's a bullet point review, not because I'm busy otherwise or lazy. But because, some times, as a viewer you feel you are putting in more effort and energy into a film than the writer/director.  Yes, you guessed right. Ragini MMS 2 is like any other B-grade horror film or Horrex (Horror-Sex for the uninclined) as Ragini MMS 2 likes to call itself. Do not be surprised if I copy-paste this review for the next similarly done film in the genre. Or maybe i should have such a ready review of this nature for each genre. Now, that's a thought.
