 is a BAD teacher. Oh and there’re no end-of-movie revelations or transformations. She’s a horrible teacher, with no real sense of responsibility, character or inclination to be of any help – and that stays. If anything, maybe one can find humor in this fact, because every other gag is either lewd or more lewd.  The film is intermittently funny, but what makes   a watchable film are the characters. Foul-mouthed, greedy and self-obsessed Elizabeth Hasley ( ) is an unapologetic character who’s returned to her teaching job at John Adams Middle School after being dumped by her fiancé. A wastrel by nature – she ends up showing movies in class for weeks at end, smokes pot in the parking lot and generally doesn’t give a rat’s... bottom. The pace of the film picks up when the new substitute teacher Scott makes an entry ( ) – he’s rich, good-hearted and the best bait for Elizabeth. That’s where the theatre begins.  She does all it takes to get his attention – from competing with the goody-two-shoes Amy ( ) to generally throwing her sexuality around.

The film steers in many directions – at some point you’re expecting the scene to get more vulgar but it cuts to a totally unrelated scene. The characters,   and   included, are funny in moments but in larger scheme of things,   heads in no particular direction and exists just for a handful.  In the film’s defense, you can squirm around in these questions and still enjoy the movie because it doesn’t try one bit to be liked.   is pretty clear in his agenda for  . You hate her so much, you will love the film. Unfortunately he got the first part right – but there’s a tiny flaw.  You hate   but you also develop the major hots for her. That might or might not work for the film, but because I can be objective about this, I can tell you that the film is watchable for a few scenes and mostly for  .
