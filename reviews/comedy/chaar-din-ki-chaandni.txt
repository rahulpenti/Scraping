 is one of the films that make you wonder 'Why did they bother?' or at least 'Why did you bother watching it?' Exasperating and as repeatedly pointed out by  's character - loud and garish -   gets on your nerves almost from the moment the director introduces himself as the narrator, that is scene 1. And loud and garish pretty much describes each character and the over-the-top performance each actor uses to demonstrate the particular idiosyncrasy assigned to their character. From  ,  , and   to  ,  ,   and  .  The few exceptions are  ,  ,   and surprisingly  .
