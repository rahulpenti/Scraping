Gone are the days when romantic comedies meant falling in love with a person who is the stark opposite of your personality – memorizing their dialogues, their looks and just living their lives with them. Before we knew it,  ,   and   is now  ,   and the likes.  Somewhere you wondered where the romance of everyday people in magical circumstances got replaced with quirky sex comedies where “love” became a dangerous drug you happen to sniff by the end of the film.

More importantly, both lead characters seem to strike a friendship more than a fairytale romance. They seem like the kind who would have great conversations over coffee and a fireplace.
