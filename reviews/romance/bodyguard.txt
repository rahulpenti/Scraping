's last half hour constantly reminded me of a Chinese curse. 
 Fortunately, maybe, all is not lost for   fans. There are at least three action packed sequences with slick moves. But somehow, a lot of the credit will be taken by the camera and editing for the "coolness". The rest of the time though, he plays the squeaky clean, Lovely Singh. The romance he's involved in drags forever and has a climax that you can laugh out your heart at - not in a good way. And the exact same laughter is brought about every time   breaks into a song. No rhyme, no reason, just been a while since the audience has seen   move his muscles, so let's edit a song in. The supposedly comic scenes on the other hand barely bring a smile or two. At other times, they bring cringes, especially when the "comic relief" side-kick comes on screen.  The one thing that I found amusing above all is that   is being played around at the hands of a woman. Otherwise, usually the women are thrown around as if they have no brains and are helpless at the hands of their men. That doesn't mean   gets a chance to have a pathbreaking performance. She does her usual pretty-young-thing bit, only she gets a little more screen time than otherwise accorded to a non-  in a   film.  Usually, for a film where only the star of the film matters, I have a disclaimer that the review doesn't apply to the star's fans. But, I doubt even hardcore Salmaniacs will enjoy   either. The star however is confident as ever and has a "I can get away with anything" attitude.  A dialogue in the film goes, " " (According to you, you are the hero. According to me, I am the hero). Who would have thought a   film could be introspective.
