Have you ever passed by those cartoons on TV which are translated in Hindi? In which dubbing for all characters seem to be done by two people - one male and one female. In which the amount of nasal shrillness defines the acting in the voice acting. The entire film is dubbed like this. Don't know what I'm talking about? Sample this -   !! WARNING !! This is just an example of the dubbing. It is neither supposed to imply that the film is entertaining nor does it mean that it is for kids.
