"How did you do it?" A question every magician takes pride in not answering. Of course,  's magician, Saahir ( ) is asked that too, but as an audience it peaked my interest only half-heartedly. Mainly because It is a tad predictable despite being indigestible. Two things in a movie that I have very little patience for - predictability and implausibility. But, then again,   has   and   trying to pull off Rajni-style stunts. How much more meta can unbelievability get? To their credit they do their best in bringing out laughter, whether well-meant or not is a matter of 'to each his own'. I did feel like observing a two minute silence in mourning as I saw   get a better role as comic relief than   as sidekick. Oh well.  But then again, with   around every one is a sidekick. So,   does his bit with an intense look persistently on his face for the first half of the film. It is annoying, but then again I walked in expecting that. But pleasantly, he shifts gears in the second half and actually pulls off his role very cleverly.  That leaves   to start with some "Indian Goddess song and dance" thing.

I just don't understand how the audience is expected to look over the fact that   is nothing but a 3 hour long chase sequence with not just enough thrills. To add fuel to fire, what the makers thought as important is repeated and in slo-mo for effect.  . And yet, I wouldn't be surprised at all if   finds its share of takers and more.
